# Project Title

This is a brief description of the project.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the /data folder exists in the root directory. If it doesn't, create it.

## Setup

1. Install the required Python libraries. You can do this by running `pip install openai llama_index chromadb`.

2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. On Windows, you can do this by running `setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your-api-key"`, replacing "your-api-key" with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Start the backend server first. Navigate to the /Backend directory and run the main.py script. You can do this by running `python main.py` in the command line.

2. Once the backend server is running, you can start the frontend. Simply open the index.html file located in the /Frontend directory in your web browser.

For easy startup/testing of the app, simply double click on the 'Start.bat' file in the root directory. This will start the backend server and open the frontend in your default web browser.
